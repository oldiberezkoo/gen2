# **Gen2 — Small Caps Generator**

Gen2 is a generator that converts text into **small caps**. It currently works with both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets and, more recently, with numbers as well. Simply enter your text in the left field, and you’ll instantly get the small caps version on the right.

For convenience, a **local history** feature has been added (stored only on your device), so you can revisit your previous conversions anytime.

**Example:**

```
github => ɢɪᴛʜʏʙ
```

**Character sets used by the script:**

* **Russian alphabet:** ᴀбʙгдᴇжзийᴋлмʜᴏпᴘᴄʏȹxцчшщъыьэюя
* **English alphabet:** ᴀʙᴄᴅᴇғɢʜɪᴊᴋʟᴍɴᴏᴘǫʀsᴛᴜᴠᴡxʏᴢ

Some characters (e.g., **Y-S**) don’t have a true small caps equivalent. In such cases, the script uses the closest available symbols.

The current implementation was designed with future development in mind. However, even with consistent monthly traffic (100–1000 visits), the tool has proven sufficient for its intended purpose, so rewriting it seems unnecessary.
